# MCP4Go

MCP4Go provides a comprehensive set of Go libraries and tools designed to simplify the development of Model Context Protocol (MCP) applications. Our goal is to allow Go developers to bypass complex low-level protocol implementation and focus directly on core resource definitions and business logic.

## Our Mission

- Lower the barrier to entry for MCP application development
- Provide high-performance, easy-to-use Go implementations of the MCP protocol
- Build rich examples and documentation to accelerate application development
- Create an active community of Go developers working with MCP
