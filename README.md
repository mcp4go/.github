# MCP4Go

MCP4Go provides a comprehensive set of Go libraries and tools designed to simplify the development of Model Context Protocol (MCP) applications. Our goal is to allow Go developers to bypass complex low-level protocol implementation and focus directly on core resource definitions and business logic.
